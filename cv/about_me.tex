\cvsection{Summary}

\begin{cvparagraph}

Software Engineer with experience in backend and front-end development, 
currently at Microsoft. 
I have a strong interest in machine learning and clean code, 
and enjoy learning programming languages such as \textbf{Rust} and \textbf{Haskell}. 
In my previous roles, I have worked on projects such as a code plagiarism detector,
where I quickly became the team's \textbf{C\#} expert. 
I'm seeking a challenging role where I can apply my skills 
and continue to grow as a developer.
